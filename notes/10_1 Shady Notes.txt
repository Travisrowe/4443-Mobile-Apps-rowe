Callbacks and Promises
    Function that can be passed as a parameter to another function so the other function will call the first function after it finishes
    
    Promises
        Async - wraps a promise
        Await - unwraps a promise
        Async-Await neds to go inside of a try-catch
        
        Don't use callbacks!
        Use Async-Await when you can, use promises when you can't
    
RX library - Reactive Programming
    Observer pattern is like adding an event to a button press
        Observer listens to Observable
    This library has a bunch of observable shit
    
Arrow functions - like inline functions so you don't have to worry about scoping problems
    const doSomething = (a, b) => {
        //do something with a and b
    }
    const is so the function cannot be overwritten later (doSomething is the function name)
    (a, b) are the parameters. if you only have one parameter, parentheses are not necessary
    => { this is the meat of the function. if you only have one thing happening in the function, you don't need brackets}
