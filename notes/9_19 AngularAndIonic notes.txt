Angular is a front-end framework based on Javascript
    Angular has Modules
    Module - made up of components and services
        - defines what to export
        
        app.module.ts is the main module
        
    decorator has
        -selector: how you call the decorator
        -templateURL: an html file - the content you see
        -styleURL: css file - the style you see
        
    How apps start
        Main.ts -> app.module.ts -> app.component.ts -> app.component.html
            
    Services are SINGLETON objects - that is, it can ONLY have one object
        if you have two objects, they share memory and when one is updated, so is the other.
        
    Angular Directives - code logic inside of an HTML file
        Most commonly used
        ngIf
        ngFor
        [(ngModel)] - binds an input to a property in its component controller (banana in a box)
        ngSwitchCase
    
Ionic
    Mobile App Framework that is built on top of Angular
    Cordova builds a bridge between web app and native app
        ex) web app can't open your camera but a native app can.
    So Ionic is the website and Cordova is the bridge
    
    Note: Ionic is responsive. it changes looks based on the device that is viewing it

Ionic code commands
    > ionic start testApp blank --type=angular //Ionic v4 is not built on top of angular anymore, Ionic 3 still is so --type=angular is not necessary in 3
                        menu    
                        tabs
                        different built-in templates for projects
                        
    Ionic 3 blank apps automatically create a home page. Delete it!
    > Ionic generate page HomePage
    creates a folder called home (it auto-detects and deletes 'Page' off the name)
    creates a class called HomePage inside of HomePageModule
    creates and exports a module called HomePageModule
    HomePage can be called by a string of its name: 'HomePage'
    
    rootPage in the app.component.ts is the start up page
    
    There are some built-in BootStrap-esque styling elements in Ionic such as
        <button ion-button block round>ButtonCaption</button> which creates a default-styled button that fills the page and has rounded edges
        
    home.ts is connected to home.html using the templateURL in home.ts
        templateUrl: 'home.html'
        
    Display list of numbers
    <ion-label *ngFor="let varName of listName"> [{varName}] </ion-label>
    
    > npm install firebase angularfire2
        angularfire2 talks to firebase for angular 
        Go to Firebase website and grab webapp code to include the Firebase database in your project
        add it to a file and export it.
        
    ToastController is an object that allows you to display a pop-up message to a user, for example an error message
    LoadingController is another component that displays a loading circle.
